R code to replicate simulations from Wolf et al. (2021)

runall.sh runs simulations across all six different simulation scenarios for
each of the four tested Step 1 models.

Cond.R runs 10 simulations for a given data generating scenario and Step 1 model
for p = 10, 20, 50 covariates and all Step 2 models.

Note that the functions used to fit the Step 2 models are different here than in
the package tehtuner. This is because the simulation study was designed to fit
multiple Step 2 models at once, which should not be done in practice, in order
to speed up computation times.

analysis.R aggregates all these results and calculates summary measures for each
simulated data set (whether or not TEH was detected, the sensitivity and
specificity, and the MSE).
