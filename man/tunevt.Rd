An object of class \code{"tunevt"} is a list containing at least the
following components:
\item{call}{the matched call}
\item{vtmod}{the model estimated by the given \code{step2} procedure fit
with the permuted tuning parameter for the estimated CATEs from the
\code{step1} model. See \code{\link{vt2_lasso}},
\code{\link{vt2_rtree}}, or \code{\link{vt2_ctree}} for specifics.}
\item{mnpp}{the MNPP for the estimated CATEs from Step 1.}
\item{theta_null}{a vector of the MNPPs from each permutation under
the null hypothesis.}
\item{z}{if \code{keepz = TRUE}, the estimated CATEs from the
\code{step1} model.}

\description{
\code{tunevt} fits a Virtual Twins model to estimate factors and subgroups
associated with differential treatment effects while controlling the Type I
error rate of falsely detecting at least one heterogeneous effect when the
treatment effect is uniform across the study population.
}
\details{
Virtual Twins is a two-step approach to detecting differential treatment
effects. Subjects' conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) are first
estimated in Step 1 using a flexible model. Then, a simple and interpretable
model is fit in Step 2 to model these estimated CATEs as a function of the
covariates.

The Step 2 model is dependent on some tuning parameter. This parameter is
selected to control the Type I error rate by permuting the data under the
null hypothesis of a constant treatment effect and identifying the minimal
null penalty parameter (MNPP), which is the smallest penalty parameter that
yields a Step 2 model with no covariate effects. The \code{1-alpha0} quantile
of the distribution of is then used to fit the Step 2 model on the original
data.
