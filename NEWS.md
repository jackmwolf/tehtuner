# tehtuner 0.1.0

This is a new package that implements the Virtual Twins algorithm for subgroup
identification (Foster et al., 2011) while controlling the probability of falsely detecting
differential treatment effects when the conditional treatment effect is constant
across the population of interest. These methods were originally presented in 
Wolf et al. (2022).

-   `tunevt()` fits a Virtual Twins model using user-specified Step 1 and Step 2
    models with parameter selection to control the probability of a false
    discovery.
