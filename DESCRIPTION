Description: Implements methods to fit Virtual Twins models (Foster et al. 
  (2011) <doi:10.1002/sim.4322>) for identifying subgroups with differential
  effects in the context of clinical trials while controlling the probability
  of falsely detecting a differential effect when the conditional average
  treatment effect is uniform across the study population using parameter
  selection methods proposed in Wolf et al. (2022) 
  <doi:10.1177/17407745221095855>.
