Description: Implements methods to fit Virtual Twins models (Foster et al. 
  (2011) <doi:10.1002/sim.4322>) for identifying subgroups with differential
  effects in the context of clinical trials while controlling the Type I error
  of falsely detecting a differential effect when the conditional average
  treatment effect is uniform across the study population.
